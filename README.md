#  Features
- multplie layers
- Gradients
- circle shape
- grain
- perlin noise
- blur (C#-based)
- rgba channels
- blend modes (override, alpha, additive, multiply)
- immediate tweak and see any texture values dynamicly, without recreation

# Planned
- make Odin Inspector optional
- offset
- rotation?
- layer to apply material / shader
- replace slow C# blur with fast GPU/shader-based (stay single-file)
- more shape layers (stars, rectangles)
- external image layer
- HDR blending
- Gradient gamma curve
- export to .png
